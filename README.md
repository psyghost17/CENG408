# CENG408 - Internship Management System
  Computer engineering students need to have internship experience that is as important as theoretical part of education to be graduated. However, finding an appropriate workplace can take too much time in education semester and it is possible that a student can miss intern requests of most wanted companies. Moreover, each student has different skills and variety of interest on computer science. In our “Internship Management System”, project attempts to provide a solution to these problems. Student skills will be transcripts of computer engineering students and the project was determined based on Çankaya University Engineering Faculty’s internship regulations. With this project, we aim to facilitate the work of computer engineering students of Çankaya University who want to find appropriate internship workplace to translate their theoretical skills to efficient internship experience.
